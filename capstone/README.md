November 2017

### Install

This capstone project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Kares](https://keras.io/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

The Kares and Tensorflow can be installed as follows:

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
```

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `capstone/` (that contains this README) and run the following command:

```
jupyter notebook capstone.ipynb

```

### Data

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset is publically avilable at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data

The instructions of the dataset are available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names
